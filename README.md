## VSCode extension for mcjspacker
This is a vscode extension for [mcjspacker](https://github.com/ofek2608/mcjspacker/)
Autocomplete is pretty simple, but at some point we should be able to integrate [spyglassmc](https://spyglassmc.com/).

If you want to build the extension yourself, don't forget to run esbuild!
You can do that with bun commands, but it can get weird because vsce is hardcoded to use npm and yarn.
